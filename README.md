## 🔎 Project Details

### 🧩 CPP Modules 05–09 – In Progress 🔧

A continuation of the C++ learning path, these modules explore more advanced topics such as exceptions, templates, the Standard Template Library (STL), and deeper aspects of object-oriented programming.

- **Objective:**  
  Implement and understand advanced C++ concepts, including exception handling, templates, containers, iterators, and complex class structures.

- **Challenges Currently Facing:**  
    - Designing template classes that remain flexible yet type-safe.  
    - Managing exceptions properly in complex class hierarchies.  
    - Understanding the nuances of the STL and choosing appropriate containers and algorithms.

- **Skills Being Developed:**  
    - Templates (function templates, class templates, specialization)  
    - STL containers and algorithms  
    - Exception handling patterns  
    - Advanced OOP and code architecture  

#### Module Breakdown:

1. **CPP05 – Exceptions & Try/Catch**
2. **CPP06 – Casting & Serialization**
3. **CPP07 – Templates (Basics)**
4. **CPP08 – STL & Containers**
5. **CPP09 – Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures**

### 💬 ft_irc – In Progress 🔧

A fully functional IRC server built from scratch, implementing the RFC 1459 protocol.

- **Objective:**  
  Implement an Internet Relay Chat server capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously, managing channels, processing commands, and ensuring compliant real-time communication.

- **Challenges Currently Facing:**  
    - Handling multiple clients with non-blocking I/O and poll/select mechanisms.  
    - Implementing the IRC protocol cleanly while keeping the code modular and scalable.  
    - Ensuring correct synchronization between server, clients, and channels.

- **Skills Being Developed:**  
    - Socket programming  
    - Network protocols (TCP/IP)  
    - Real-time communication handling  
    - Server architecture and data synchronization

### 🐳 Inception – In Progress 🔧

A DevOps-oriented project requiring the setup of an entire infrastructure using Docker, composing multiple services that work together.

- **Objective:**  
  Create a multi-container environment using Docker Compose, including NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB, all running securely and in isolation.

- **Challenges Currently Facing:**  
    - Understanding container orchestration and service networking.  
    - Implementing persistence with volumes while maintaining container isolation.  
    - Managing configuration, SSL, and service dependencies.

- **Skills Being Developed:**  
    - Dockerfile creation  
    - Docker Compose orchestration  
    - Linux system administration  
    - Reverse proxy configuration, networking, SSL
