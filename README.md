## 💬 ft_irc (w/ joao-alm) – 125/100 🌟

### Objective
Implement a fully functional **IRC server** in C++, compliant with the IRC protocol, capable of handling multiple clients simultaneously.

### Key Features Implemented
- TCP server using **non-blocking sockets**
- Client connection handling with `poll()`
- Core IRC commands (`PASS`, `NICK`, `USER`, `JOIN`, `PART`, `PRIVMSG`, `QUIT`, etc.)
- Channel management (operators, topics, modes)
- Protocol-compliant replies and robust error handling
- Bonus features implemented → **125/100**

### Challenges Faced
- Designing a scalable architecture for clients, channels, and commands
- Managing concurrency and asynchronous I/O
- Ensuring strict protocol compliance
- Handling edge cases such as partial reads, disconnects, and invalid commands

### Skills Developed
- Advanced C++ design and clean architecture
- Network programming with sockets
- Event-driven programming using `poll()`
- Implementation of real-world communication protocols

## 🖥️ CPP Modules 05–09 – 100/100 ✅

### Objective
Deepen C++ expertise through advanced language features and standard library usage.

### Challenges Faced
- Understanding the nuances of different cast types and when to appropriately use each one required careful study of type safety.
- Implementing exception handling without memory leaks and ensuring proper resource management in error scenarios.
- Mastering template syntax and debugging template compilation errors, which can be cryptic and difficult to interpret.
- Learning to efficiently use STL algorithms and choosing the right container for specific use cases based on performance requirements.

### Skills Developed
- Exception handling and error management, type casting and conversions, template programming and generic code design, STL containers and algorithms mastery, and performance optimization techniques.

### Module Details

1. **CPP05 – Exceptions and Error Handling**
   - **Objective:** Exception handling mechanisms, try-catch blocks, custom exception classes, and error propagation in C++.
   - **Score: 100/100 ✅**

2. **CPP06 – C++ Casts and Type Conversions**
   - **Objective:** Type casting in C++ including static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, reinterpret_cast, and understanding type conversion rules.
   - **Score: 100/100 ✅**

3. **CPP07 – Templates and Generic Programming**
   - **Objective:** Function templates, class templates, template specialization, and writing generic, reusable code.
   - **Score: 100/100 ✅**

4. **CPP08 – STL Containers, Iterators, and Algorithms**
   - **Objective:** Standard Template Library containers (vector, list, map, etc.), iterators, and standard algorithms for data manipulation.
   - **Score: 100/100 ✅**

5. **CPP09 – Advanced STL Usage and Performance Considerations**
   - **Objective:** Complex STL usage patterns, container adapters (stack, queue), algorithm optimization, and performance analysis.
   - **Score: 100/100 ✅**
